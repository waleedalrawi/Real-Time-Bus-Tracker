# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description

This tool tracks in real time all the vehicles of a given Boston MBTA route. Select the route you wish to view and you will see all current vehicles running that route on the map.

Added a button to stop updating, a button to restart updating, and a route selector. Also added a favicon.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Will add custome bus icons and tooltips with info of next stop for each bus.
